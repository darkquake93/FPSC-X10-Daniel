;Artificial Intelligence Script

;Header
desc          = When activated, plays a sound. Can be switched off. For some weird reason, using a switch for this makes the activated value become 0. That's why when it's "Activated with 0" it plays the sound.

;Triggers

:plrwithinzone=0:stopsound
:state=0:activated=0,state=1
:state=1,plrwithinzone=1,activated=0:sound=$0

;End of Script
