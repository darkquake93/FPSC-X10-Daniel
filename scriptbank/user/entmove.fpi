;Artificial Intelligence Script

desc          = Moves the entity to the target name. Moves up (just to get out of sight) when deactivated. I couldn't get any other action working to get it out of the way.

;Triggers

:state=0,activated=1:settargetname=move,movetotarget,timerstart,state=1
:state=1,timergreater=400:freeze
:state=1,activated=0:state=2,moveup=200
